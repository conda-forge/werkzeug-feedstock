  summary: The comprehensive WSGI web application library.
  description: |
      **_werkzeug_** German noun: "tool". Etymology: *werk* ("work"), *zeug* ("stuff")

      Werkzeug is a comprehensive [WSGI](https://wsgi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) web application library. It began as
      a simple collection of various utilities for WSGI applications and has
      become one of the most advanced WSGI utility libraries.

      It includes:

        -   An interactive debugger that allows inspecting stack traces and
            source code in the browser with an interactive interpreter for any
            frame in the stack.
        -   A full-featured request object with objects to interact with
            headers, query args, form data, files, and cookies.
        -   A response object that can wrap other WSGI applications and handle
            streaming data.
        -   A routing system for matching URLs to endpoints and generating URLs
            for endpoints, with an extensible system for capturing variables
            from URLs.
        -   HTTP utilities to handle entity tags, cache control, dates, user
            agents, cookies, files, and more.
        -   A threaded WSGI server for use while developing applications
            locally.
        -   A test client for simulating HTTP requests during testing without
            requiring running a server.

      Werkzeug doesn't enforce any dependencies. It is up to the developer to
      choose a template engine, database adapter, and even how to handle
      requests. It can be used to build all sorts of end user applications
      such as blogs, wikis, or bulletin boards.

      [Flask](https://www.palletsprojects.com/p/flask/) wraps Werkzeug, using it to handle the details of WSGI while
      providing more structure and patterns for defining powerful
      applications.
