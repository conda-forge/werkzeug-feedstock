  summary: The comprehensive WSGI web application library.
  description: |
    **_werkzeug_** German noun: "tool". Etymology: *werk* ("work"), *zeug* ("stuff")

    Werkzeug is a comprehensive [WSGI](https://wsgi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) web application library. It began as
    a simple collection of various utilities for WSGI applications and has
    become one of the most advanced WSGI utility libraries.

    It includes:

      -   An interactive debugger that allows inspecting stack traces and
          source code in the browser with an interactive interpreter for any
          frame in the stack.
      -   A full-featured request object with objects to interact with
          headers, query args, form data, files, and cookies.
      -   A response object that can wrap other WSGI applications and handle
          streaming data.
      -   A routing system for matching URLs to endpoints and generating URLs
          for endpoints, with an extensible system for capturing variables
          from URLs.
      -   HTTP utilities to handle entity tags, cache control, dates, user
          agents, cookies, files, and more.
      -   A threaded WSGI server for use while developing applications
          locally.
      -   A test client for simulating HTTP requests during testing without
          requiring running a server.

    Werkzeug doesn't enforce any dependencies. It is up to the developer to
    choose a template engine, database adapter, and even how to handle
    requests. It can be used to build all sorts of end user applications
    such as blogs, wikis, or bulletin boards.

    [Flask](https://www.palletsprojects.com/p/flask/) wraps Werkzeug, using it to handle the details of WSGI while
    providing more structure and patterns for defining powerful
    applications.
