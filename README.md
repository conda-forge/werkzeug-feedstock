Summary: The comprehensive WSGI web application library.

Development: https://github.com/pallets/werkzeug

Documentation: https://werkzeug.palletsprojects.com/

**_werkzeug_** German noun: "tool". Etymology: *werk* ("work"), *zeug* ("stuff")

Werkzeug is a comprehensive [WSGI](https://wsgi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) web application library. It began as
a simple collection of various utilities for WSGI applications and has
become one of the most advanced WSGI utility libraries.

It includes:

  -   An interactive debugger that allows inspecting stack traces and
      source code in the browser with an interactive interpreter for any
      frame in the stack.
  -   A full-featured request object with objects to interact with
      headers, query args, form data, files, and cookies.
  -   A response object that can wrap other WSGI applications and handle
      streaming data.
  -   A routing system for matching URLs to endpoints and generating URLs
      for endpoints, with an extensible system for capturing variables
      from URLs.
  -   HTTP utilities to handle entity tags, cache control, dates, user
      agents, cookies, files, and more.
  -   A threaded WSGI server for use while developing applications
      locally.
  -   A test client for simulating HTTP requests during testing without
      requiring running a server.

Werkzeug doesn't enforce any dependencies. It is up to the developer to
choose a template engine, database adapter, and even how to handle
requests. It can be used to build all sorts of end user applications
such as blogs, wikis, or bulletin boards.

[Flask](https://www.palletsprojects.com/p/flask/) wraps Werkzeug, using it to handle the details of WSGI while
providing more structure and patterns for defining powerful
applications.

Installing werkzeug
===================

Installing `werkzeug` from the `conda-forge` channel can be achieved by adding `conda-forge` to your channels with:

```
conda config --add channels conda-forge
conda config --set channel_priority strict
```

Once the `conda-forge` channel has been enabled, `werkzeug` can be installed with `conda`:

```
conda install werkzeug
```

or with `mamba`:

```
mamba install werkzeug
```

It is possible to list all of the versions of `werkzeug` available on your platform with `conda`:

```
conda search werkzeug --channel conda-forge
```

or with `mamba`:

```
mamba search werkzeug --channel conda-forge
```

Alternatively, `mamba repoquery` may provide more information:

```
# Search all versions available on your platform:
mamba repoquery search werkzeug --channel conda-forge

# List packages depending on `werkzeug`:
mamba repoquery whoneeds werkzeug --channel conda-forge

# List dependencies of `werkzeug`:
mamba repoquery depends werkzeug --channel conda-forge
```


About conda-forge
=================

conda-forge is a community-led conda channel of installable packages.
In order to provide high-quality builds, the process has been automated into the
conda-forge GitHub organization. The conda-forge organization contains one repository
for each of the installable packages. Such a repository is known as a *feedstock*.

A feedstock is made up of a conda recipe (the instructions on what and how to build
the package) and the necessary configurations for automatic building using freely
available continuous integration services. Thanks to the awesome service provided by
[Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devops/), [GitHub](https://github.com/),
[CircleCI](https://circleci.com/), [AppVeyor](https://www.appveyor.com/),
[Drone](https://cloud.drone.io/welcome), and [TravisCI](https://travis-ci.com/)
it is possible to build and upload installable packages to the
[conda-forge](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge) [anaconda.org](https://anaconda.org/)
channel for Linux, Windows and OSX respectively.

To manage the continuous integration and simplify feedstock maintenance
[conda-smithy](https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-smithy) has been developed.
Using the ``conda-forge.yml`` within this repository, it is possible to re-render all of
this feedstock's supporting files (e.g. the CI configuration files) with ``conda smithy rerender``.

For more information please check the [conda-forge documentation](https://conda-forge.org/docs/).

Terminology
===========

**feedstock** - the conda recipe (raw material), supporting scripts and CI configuration.

**conda-smithy** - the tool which helps orchestrate the feedstock.
                   Its primary use is in the construction of the CI ``.yml`` files
                   and simplify the management of *many* feedstocks.

**conda-forge** - the place where the feedstock and smithy live and work to
                  produce the finished article (built conda distributions)


Updating werkzeug-feedstock
===========================

If you would like to improve the werkzeug recipe or build a new
package version, please fork this repository and submit a PR. Upon submission,
your changes will be run on the appropriate platforms to give the reviewer an
opportunity to confirm that the changes result in a successful build. Once
merged, the recipe will be re-built and uploaded automatically to the
`conda-forge` channel, whereupon the built conda packages will be available for
everybody to install and use from the `conda-forge` channel.
Note that all branches in the conda-forge/werkzeug-feedstock are
immediately built and any created packages are uploaded, so PRs should be based
on branches in forks and branches in the main repository should only be used to
build distinct package versions.

In order to produce a uniquely identifiable distribution:
 * If the version of a package **is not** being increased, please add or increase
   the [``build/number``](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda-build/en/latest/resources/define-metadata.html#build-number-and-string).
 * If the version of a package **is** being increased, please remember to return
   the [``build/number``](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda-build/en/latest/resources/define-metadata.html#build-number-and-string)
   back to 0.
